["CURRENT is a multidisciplinary and intersectional music and electronic art symposium working with women and non-binary artists in Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest. The first iteration of the project will be a 3-day music and arts showcase featuring events, panels, youth mentorships and workshops, which will take place July 28th-30th, 2017. The goal of this symposium is to foster and disseminate feminist content through the cross-pollination of ideas and intergenerational knowledge sharing. By offering free, public, all-ages panels and workshops, we wish to cultivate growth within the local community and create a more equal landscape within the Electronic Arts ecology."]
